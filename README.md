# MRI Classification Process with CNN

## Overview

The goal of our model is to classify MRI brain scans into four categories of Alzheimer’s disease progression:
- No Impairment
- Very Mild Impairment
- Mild Impairment
- Moderate Impairment

To do this, we follow these essential steps:

## 1️⃣ Data Preparation & Organization

### Why is this important?
Before training a model, we need to organize the dataset so that the model can learn patterns correctly.

### Steps Involved:
- Our dataset is structured into train and test folders.
- Each of these contains four subfolders—one for each stage of Alzheimer’s.
- Example structure:



            /dataset  
            ├── /train  
            │   ├── /Mild Impairment  
            │   ├── /Moderate Impairment  
            │   ├── /No Impairment  
            │   ├── /Very Mild Impairment  
            ├── /test  
            │   ├── /Mild Impairment  
            │   ├── /Moderate Impairment  
            │   ├── /No Impairment  
            │   ├── /Very Mild Impairment  
        


- The training dataset is used to teach the model, and the test dataset is used to evaluate how well it learned.

## 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Augmentation

### Why do we do this?
Medical images may have variations in brightness, orientation, or size. CNNs work best when images are consistent and diverse enough to generalize well.

### Normalization (Rescaling)
- MRI images have pixel values ranging from 0 to 255.
- We normalize them by dividing by 255, so all values fall between 0 and 1.
- This makes training faster and helps prevent large numerical values from dominating the learning process.

### Data Augmentation
- Since deep learning models need a lot of data, we artificially expand the dataset using transformations:
- **Rotation**: Rotates the images slightly to make the model robust to different scan angles.
- **Shifting**: Moves images left/right/up/down so the model learns that location is not important.
- **Shearing**: Skews images slightly to simulate different perspectives.
- **Zooming**: Zooms in or out to make the model focus on key details.
- **Flipping**: Flips images horizontally (since MRI scans can have left-right symmetry).

These techniques help prevent overfitting, where the model memorizes training images instead of learning general patterns.

## 3️⃣ Data Splitting Strategy

### Why do we split data?
We divide the dataset into three parts to train and evaluate the model fairly:
- **Training Set (80%)** – The model learns from this.
- **Validation Set (20% of Training Set)** – Used to check accuracy during training.
- **Test Set (100% separate from training)** – Used to evaluate the final model.

This ensures the model is tested on completely new data, just like in real-world scenarios.

## 4️⃣ Building the CNN Model

CNNs are perfect for image classification because they extract features like edges, textures, and patterns.

### How CNN Works
- **Convolutional Layers**: These detect patterns like edges, textures, and shapes in MRI images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce the size of feature maps while keeping important details.
- **Flattening**: Converts 2D feature maps into a 1D vector to connect to fully connected layers.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Learn complex patterns and make final predictions.
- **Softmax Activation**: Converts outputs into probability scores for the four categories.

## 5️⃣ Training the Model
- The model looks at images batch by batch and updates its knowledge.
- It uses categorical cross-entropy loss (because we have multiple classes).
- The optimizer (Adam) adjusts the model based on errors.
- Training continues for several epochs (repeating the dataset multiple times).

## 6️⃣ Evaluating Performance
- The model is tested on unseen test data to check accuracy.
- Graphs of accuracy/loss over epochs help diagnose issues like overfitting.
- If needed, we fine-tune the model (adjusting layers, changing learning rate, or adding more data).

## 7️⃣ Conclusion: Why CNN Works Best for MRI

1. **Automatically learns important patterns**: Unlike traditional methods where features are manually extracted, CNNs automatically find patterns like brain atrophy.
2. **Handles complex medical images**: MRI scans have subtle differences, and CNNs can detect these better than traditional algorithms.
3. **Reduces computational cost**: CNNs use convolution & pooling to reduce data size without losing key features.
4. **Data Augmentation improves generalization**: Helps the model work well on new, unseen MRI scans, making it more reliable.

## Final Thoughts

This process makes MRI classification efficient, scalable, and accurate. With more data and deeper models (e.g., pre-trained networks like ResNet), we can achieve even higher accuracy for real-world clinical applications.
